I won first place at 2019 Bouldering Competition held by Seoul National University.

Even though I competed with only four other participants, it was a truly exciting experience!

Bouldering taught me how to climb, overcome, sometimes even conquer an immediate obstacle on my way. But I also learned how to rest, appreciate others' amazing bouldering abilities, and enjoy little chatting with other boulders. 

Life might be like bouldering - I must believe I am brave enough to move on at the moment when I doubt.
