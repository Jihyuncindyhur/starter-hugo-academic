Jihyun Hur is a research technician in the [Rutledge Lab](https://rutledgelab.org/) directed by [Dr. Robb Rutledge](https://thehappinessexperiment.org/) at Yale University. In August 2021, she received a Master's degree in Clinical Psychology at [Computational Clinical Scinece Lab](https://ccs-lab.github.io/) directed by [Dr. Woo-Young Ahn](https://ccs-lab.github.io/team/young-ahn/). After graduating from [Washington University in St. Louis]("https://olin.wustl.edu/EN-US/Pages/default.aspx) with the Bachelor's degree in Accounting (Honors in Management), she started to wonder the essence of mental health, human decision-making processes and emotions. 

Jihyun is particularly interested in 1) understanding the latent decision-making processes of depression and anxiety using computational modeling, 2) developing individualized intervention plans to prevent suicidal attempts, and 3) delving into the complex relationship between emotions and decision-making. She has been mainly utilizing `neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI, fNIRS)`, `computational modeling` and `machine learning`.

She pursues to be a PhD student in Clinical Psychology at an university based in the United States. 

Outside the lab, she is a rock climber, pianist, and (occasionally) k-pop dancer :dancer::smile:
