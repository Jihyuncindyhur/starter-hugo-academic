Jihyun Hur is a Master's student in Clinical Psychology at [Computational Clinical Scinece Lab](https://ccs-lab.github.io/) directed by [Dr. Woo-Young Ahn](https://ccs-lab.github.io/team/young-ahn/). She graduated from [Washington University in St. Louis]("https://olin.wustl.edu/EN-US/Pages/default.aspx), majoring in Accounting with Honors in Management. After receiving the Bachelor's degree, she started to wonder the nature of human decision-making and emotion. 

Now she is particularly interested in 1)revealing the transdiagnostic phenotypes of depression and anxiety in the `reinforcement learning` domain and 2)understanding the relationship between negative urgency and decision-making. She has been mainly utilizing `neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI, fNIRS)`, `computational modeling` and `machine learning`.

After graduation, she pursues to be a PhD student in Clinical Psychology at an university based in the United States. 

Outside the lab, she is a rock climber, pianist, and (occasionally) k-pop dancer :dancer::smile:
